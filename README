
RPGConquestGame is a test game project about conquering and maintaining control of a Region, Town, Suburb or Street against other players.
The game is a worker placement game where your spies and agents try to investigate each other and control sectors of the map.
This game is originally meant to be an accessory to a LARP event where the players can discuss actions and objectives.
But it may evolve into a stand alone Game of its own.

Project :
 - This project was run as a personal training exercise on the use, quality and lack of, for GPT-4o mini, and from beta version Curor AI. Much of the code and texts will be ChatGPT/ClaudCode/Cursor generated.
 - All code review should take into account the previous statement, the additional lack of time and non commercial destination of the project. (Be nice.)

   Post 1st Test Game Notes:
   - By Turn 3, the volume of generated information took players up to 20 minutes to process. Negotiations and discussions added significant time on top of that.
   - The next test game will feature teams of three per faction, with an estimated duration of 2 hours per turn.

   Post 2 Game Notes :
   - Full LARP event with 18 players (6 factions of 3 on the Shikoku 1555 config) was a success.
   - Updates for players usage and quality will be added.
