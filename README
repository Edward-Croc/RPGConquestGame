
RPGConquestGame is a test game project about conquering and maintaining control of a Town, Suburb or Street against AI or other players.
The game is a worker placement game where your spies and agents try to investigate each other and control sectors of the map.
This game is originally meant to be an accessory to a LARP event where the players can discuss actions and objectives.
But it may evolve into a stand alone Game of its own.

Post 1st Test Game Notes:
 - By Turn 3, the volume of generated information took players up to 20 minutes to process. Negotiations and discussions added significant time on top of that.
 - The next test game will feature teams of three per faction, with an estimated duration of 2 hours per turn.
